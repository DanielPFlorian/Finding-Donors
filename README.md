#finding-donors

finding-donors employs several supervised learning algorithms to accurately model
individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. The goal is
to accurately predict whether an individual makes more than $50,000 in order to
reduce an organizations overhead cost of sending mail to potential donors. The 
models are evaluated and optimized to determine which algorithm yields the
greatest accuracy.
