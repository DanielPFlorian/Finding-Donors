    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "## Preparing the Data\n",
    "Before data can be used as input for machine learning algorithms, it often must be cleaned, formatted, and restructured — this is typically known as **preprocessing**. Fortunately, for this dataset, there are no invalid or missing entries we must deal with, however, there are some qualities about certain features that must be adjusted. This preprocessing can help tremendously with the outcome and predictive power of nearly all learning algorithms."

    "### Transforming Skewed Continuous Features\n",
    "A dataset may sometimes contain at least one feature whose values tend to lie near a single number, but will also have a non-trivial number of vastly larger or smaller values than that single number.  Algorithms can be sensitive to such distributions of values and can underperform if the range is not properly normalized. With the census dataset two features fit this description: '`capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`. \n",

    "Run the code cell below to plot a histogram of these two features. Note the range of the values present and how they are distributed."

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",

    "### Implementation: Data Preprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",
    "\n",
    "|   | someFeature |                    | someFeature_A | someFeature_B | someFeature_C |\n",

    "| 0 |  B  |  | 0 | 1 | 0 |\n",
    "| 1 |  C  | ----> one-hot encode ----> | 0 | 0 | 1 |\n",
    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",
    " - Convert the target label `'income_raw'` to numerical entries.\n",
    "   - Set records with \"<=50K\" to `0` and records with \">50K\" to `1`."

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classification), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   For this machine learning problem I have chosen the **Gaussian Naive Bayes**, **Gradient Boosting** and **Support Vector Machine** supervised learning models.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   The **Gaussian Naive Bayes** model is commonly used in the medical field to diagnose a number of diseases (Langarizadeh & Moghbeli, 2016). One example is diagnosing whether a tumor is benign or cancerous based off of a number of predictor features such as cell size, cell shape, and clump thickness (Gayathari & Sumathi, 2016). This diagnosis informs the decisions of the practioner and patient on whether treatment is necessary.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   Naive Bayes is easily implemented and trained. The model does not require a lot of tuning in order to produce accurate results, performing well in most binary and multiclass classification problems. This model is also fast and computationally efficient compared to other models. It requires little training data yet runs quickly even with a large data set with many features (Kumar & Sowmya, 2021).\n",
    "   \n",
    "   In certain scenarios Naive Bayes may not be the best model. One weakness is due to the nature of the algorithm to assume feature independence. If predictor features are highly interdependent, then the naive assumption of feature independence can lower predictive performance (Chen et al., 2021).\n",
    "   \n",
    "   Guassian Naive Bayes is a good candidate for this problem as the census data has multiple categorical variables and this is a binary classification problem (whether an individual makes more than 50K or not). Since we have normalized the data, a gaussian algorithm will not be impacted by outliers in the distribution.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   **Gradient Boosting** has been used in particle physics to detect signal from background noise in the massive amounts of data produced by particle colliders (Cornell et al., 2022). Sifting through this data, particles can be identified and avenues to search for potential particle candidates can be discovered with this model.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   Very high predictive accuracy can be achieved with a properly tuned Gradient Boosting model. This model is flexible due to its many hyper-parameter options. Gradient Boosting algorithms are also able to handle redundant features and imbalanced data sets.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   Due to the many hyper-parameters that can be set in Gradient Boosting, tuning the model requires a large grid search which can be time consuming. If not tuned properly, this model can lead to overfitting. Depending on the number of decision trees and other hyper-parameters used, Gradient Boosting can be computationally expensive (Kurama, 2021).\n",
    "   \n",
    "   Once the Gradient Boosting model is tuned to this data set, it should give high precision results to this binary classification problem. The ensemble of weighted decision trees in Gradient Boosting put weight on classifying missclassified points in each iteration of the algorithm.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   The **Support Vector Machine** (SVM) model is commonly used in the field of bioinformatics. One such example is the identification of protein structures. Using a data set of amino acid sequences, a Support Vector Machine predicts the 3d structure of proteins (Mandle et al., 2012).\n",
    "   \n",
    "   In high dimensional use cases with potentially thousands of features, SVMs perform well even with a small data set. With an appropriate kernel, SVMs can solve a variety of problems. SVMs can also provide accurate predictions when the classification boundary is non-linear (Kirchner & Signorino, 2018).\n",
    "   \n",
    "   There are some potential downsides to using SVMs. Choosing the correct kernel for the data set drastically affects the predictive performance. This algorithm is computationally costly and can require a lot of time to train, especially with large data sets. The results of SVMs are also not usually easily interpretable.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   I've chosen to use a SVM model for predicting income on the census data because if the data points in this binary classification problem are not linearly seperable, it should still perform well with the right kernel and parameters. The census data has been normalized and feature scaled so it should work well with the model.\n",

    "In order to successfully predict individuals who make more than $50,000 given the census data, I have done some preliminary testing and evaluated a few supervised learning models that showed potential to solve this problem. The results of testing Guassian Naive Bayes, Gradient Boosting and Support Vector Machine models provide clear evidence that **Gradient Boosting** is the best model for the job.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of note is the Gradient Boosting models F-score. The F-score calculates the harmonic mean between precision and recall in order to provide a more concise measurement score than just accuracy alone. For the particular case of identifying individuals who make more than 50K, precision is key as classification distributions are skewed in this data set and we want to be sure that we are correctly predicting individuals that make more than 50K. The F-score has been adjusted to give a higher score to models with higher precision. The Gradient Boosting model was the most precise predictor and received the highest F-score in all of the tests. In the test set when 100\\% of the training data is used, Gradient Boosting is the clear winner over the other models by a large margin.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even with a large data set, Gradient Boosting was quickly trained. The model only took slighlty longer to train than Naive Bayes and proved much more competent in its predictions. The SVM model took many times longer than Gradient Boosting to train, yet still recieved a lower F-score. Gradient Boosting is also extremely fast at predicting. It was as fast as the Naive Bayes model and many times faster than the SVM model. This means it is computationally efficient and will be able identify those who make more than 50K quickly and precisely.\n",
    "\n",
    "Gradient Boosting is the most suitable of the models for the problem of identifying individuals who make more than 50K given the census data. The census data set has many features that can be used in the training and predictions of the ensemble of boosted decision trees in Gradient Boosting. The model has also shown to work well in this large data set. The quick training and prediction time along with the precise prediction results make it perfect to solve our problem."

    "**Answer:** \n",
    "\n",
    "The Gradient Boosting model needs to be trained on the census data. This data first needs to be arranged in a way that the model can learn with. For each individual, their information such as age, occupation, and education level will be used as a predictor feature. Their income will be used as a label so the model knows whether it predicted the individuals correct income class of either making more than 50k or making 50k or less.   \n",
    "\n",
    "Once the data is arranged, the Gradient Boosting model can be trained. The way that the Gradient Boosting model learns is by creating a bunch of decision trees. Decision trees decide what the best predictor feature is to obtain the least amount of error. The error is the difference between the actual class the individual is in and the predicted class the algorithm estimated this individual to be in. For example, the model could decide to group individuals together based on whether they are above or below a certain age if this split gave the least amount of error. The tree can split a limited number of times, lowering the error on each consecutive decision split. After each tree is built and the remaining errors are calculated, a new decision tree is built based off of these remaining errors in order to minimize them. This occurs many times until the error is neglible and the predictions are accurate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Gradient boosting makes new predictions by taking the new examples features and passing them through all the decision trees created in training. The decision trees have already learned which features are most likely to indicate whether the individial makes more than 50k or not so the new predictions are very fast. The combined predictions of all the trees decide on the final predicted class.\n",

    "An individuals occupation is usually pretty consistent with a standard income for that occupation. Doctors and lawyers typically make more than blue-collar type jobs. In my experience, a higher education level often seems to correspond with an individual getting a higher paying, more specialized job compared to indiviudals with a lower education level. As individuals age, they often find a stable occupation and work their way up in a companies' ranks, making more money as they do. The more hours-per-week an individual works in an hourly wage type occupation, the more they will earn.

    "The models actual most important predictive features are capital-loss, age, capital-gain, hours-per-week and education-number. I originally did not think that capital-loss or capital-gain would be important indicators of an individial making more than 50k or not. Education-number and education-level correspond to a very similar almost equivalent feature, though education-number is probably a better and more precise way for the algorithm to calculate an indiviuals level of education. I ranked occupation to be the most important predictor of income, but according to the model it wasn't even in the top 5 most important predictive features. The country of an individual is also not considered an important predictor of income like I thought it was.\n",
    "\n",
    "An individuals age, hours-per-week and education are predictors that I thought would be important and this is actually so in the model. Visualizing how relevant these features are for the models predictions reinforces my thoughts of their importances in predicting an individuals income.\n",
    "\n",
    "I am suprised that occupation is not in the top 5 most relevant features for prediction. I'm guessing this is because there are so many categories/occupations in this feature for the algorithm to make a decision split on, so each one of the occupations may not hold a great weight in the overall predictions for all the individuals. Upon further thought, capital-loss and capital-gain make sense to me to be important predictive features. An individual who has capital-loss can be indicative of them not doing well financially and hence making less than 50k, while an individual with capital-gain will have increased income."

    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "

If the chosen model took considerably more time to train and make predictions, then I would consider using the reduced data as a training set since the accuracy and F-score were not substantially decreased using the reduced features.\n",
